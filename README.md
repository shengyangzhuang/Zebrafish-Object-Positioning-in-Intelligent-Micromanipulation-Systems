# Zebrafish-Object-Positioning-in-Intelligent-Micromanipulation-Systems
 Intelligent Micromanipulation Robots is a project at the interface of medicine and engineering. It is about the design and the construction of a micromanipulation robotic system, with a future aim at treating cancer patients through specific microinjection of cancer cells. It works through taking the cancer cells outside and doing the cell culture, then we conduct micro manipulation on them to find the specific medicine that can treat the disease. In the system design process, we used zebrafish as a model to test the realization of different functions of the system.
